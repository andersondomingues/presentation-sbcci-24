	abstract = {We examine an on-line polynomial time heuristic for the NP-complete problem of scheduling m identical machines to minimize the maximum lateness of jobs with release times and due dates. The main result is that for any set of jobs, the difference between the lateness given by the heuristic and the minimum possible lateness is bounded by [(2m âˆ’ 1)m]Pmax, where Pmax is the largest processing time of any of the jobs. The conclusion is that for many applications, optimization is not necessary. We also prove that when all jobs have a common processing time P, the difference between the heuristic and the minimum lateness is bounded by P. This gives a fast estimate of the minimum possible lateness, and is useful in accelerating the practical performance of algorithms for the exact solution.}
